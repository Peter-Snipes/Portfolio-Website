 ## [Crypto](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-101-f2020/crypto)

In this project called crypto I had to work in a group with my colleagues
in order to complete this assignment.

In this assignment I had to explore a topic in the fields that make up the "art and science of sending and decoding secret messages". This project had us implement, test, and evaluate several cryptography and/or cryptanalysis systems.

In this project we had to do some research and use different types of Caesar and Vigenere ciphers. We used these ciphers to clearly demonstrate
that we could send a secret message. All of our additions to the project had the words input from the user do different things to ultimately change the inputted message to something else.
