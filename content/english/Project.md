## [MathRunner](https://github.com/ReadyResearchers/MathRunner)

I decided to create a 2D math game for children called "MathRunner". My motivation for creating this game was when working with kids I noticed that they wasn't doing the best in math. But one thing every kid had in common was their attention is taken as soon as an electronic is turned on such as tv, laptop, game system, or some type of game they are immediately drawn in and they will pay full attention to that. With this information I came to the conclusion that with this 2D Procedurally Generated game based on color psychology I will be able to cause a huge impact on these kids life in a very positive way.

## [MemoryScanner](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-400-fall-2022/computer-science-400-fall-2022-long-term-systems-project-Peter-Snipes)

In this project, I have developed a MemoryScanner using the psutil tool and programming it in Python. The main objective of my project is to analyze the memory usage on your computer and present the information on the screen for users to view. By scanning the computer's memory, the program will identify the applications currently in use and display the corresponding memory usage. Moreover, it will provide users with the option to terminate or keep running a specific program based on their preferences.

My plan is to create a program that can delve into the operating system and offer an overview of the memory consumption by the applications running on the device. By utilizing the capabilities of psutil, users will be able to specify which application they are interested in, such as Firefox, and the program will retrieve and display the memory consumption specifically for the Firefox program. This approach will enable users to gain insights into the memory utilization of their device and manage their applications more efficiently.

## [Team 7](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-202-spring-2023/cmpsc202-spring-2023-project-team-7)

For our project, we will be implementing Binary Search Trees (BST) and focusing on their basic operations. These operations will include search, insert, and depth-first traversals. In addition to these, we also implemented some new operations such as deleting all three cases for any given node, finding the lowest common ancestors for two given nodes, and finding the in-order predecessor and successor for any given node. By implementing these operations, we wanted to gain a better understanding of how BSTs work and how we can use them to efficiently manipulate data. This is because BSTs can be used as a powerful tool to search, store, and delete large amounts of data. This is due to its nature and general structure as a logical data structure, allowing us to take advantage of this to quickly and efficiently traverse the tree.
