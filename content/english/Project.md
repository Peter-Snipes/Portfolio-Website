 ## [MathRunner](https://github.com/ReadyResearchers/MathRunner)

I decided to create a 2D math game for children called "MathRunner". My motivation for creating this game was when working with kids I noticed that they wasn't doing the best in math. But one thing every kid had in common was their attention is taken as soon as an electronic is turned on such as tv, laptop, game system, or some type of game they are immediately drawn in and they will pay full attention to that. With this information I came to the conclusion that with this 2D Procedurally Generated game based on color psychology I will be able to cause a huge impact on these kids life in a very positive way.
