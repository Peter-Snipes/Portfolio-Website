I have had plenty of jobs that required many skills that are required to be successful in a professional
cmpsc workplace.

In different jobs I had growing up I've developed many different skills that I use till this day. various skills
that I developed are problem solving skills, patience, teamwork, leadership, time management, and many more.
All these skills that I possess are essential for any person to have in a professional work setting.

Although I dont have any professional experience in a cmpsc job I have taken a bunch of classes that are preparing
me for the next step in my life. Different classes that I've taken that helped me over the years are:
 - CMPSC*100*	Computational Expression
 - CMPSC*101*	Data Abstraction
 - CMPSC*102*	Discrete Structures
 - CMPSC*200*	Computer Organization
 - CMPSC*203*	Software Engineering
 - CMPSC*480*	Software Innovation I
