My name is Peter Snipes I am a junior at Allegheny College and I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics.

<!--more-->

I have a very wide range of interest in different career paths in Computer Science. Different things that I am interested in
are Software Development, Cyber Security, Web Development, Front end and Back end computing.

However If I get the chance to get a internship in a different category Ill gladly take it because I was as much experience
I can get to better my understanding and general knowledge of Cmpsc.
